# news-aggregator
News aggregator for my end of 1st year project at ENSIAS.

# Abstract
With the increasing rate at which news websites are appearing and disappearing,the need for a reliable tool to collect, process and display content from across theweb is proving to be more and more of an necessity. In this project, we will delve into the deeper mechanics of how data is scrapped from the web using Python and the BeautifulSoup library, stored and queried using a database, and interactively accessed through a web application built with Python and its librairies (Django, MongDB, BeautifulSoup...), HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Through our news aggregator project, we seek to enhance the user’s experience bygathering the news together, all into one platform. To that purpose, a multitude offilters could be used, including : providing keywords, choosing a language (French, English or Arabic) before scrapping the corresponding data from 4 websites: MAP, Hespress, France24 and Euronews. That should enablethe user to gain in efficiency and minimize scrolling time and effort. The user will also be allowed to locally save the search results either as a CSV file, or share any article on one of his social media accounts (twitter, facebook or whatsapp).

The importance of our project lies in the very nature of news: much of what we know, or think we know, about what is happening in the world we learn by reading the news. However, what we nowadays refer to as “the news” means something different than it did in generations past. What we read primarily today are articles onthe internet—everything ranging from casual blog posts to meticulously researched stories on national and international news sites.
